# Simulation Restarting Script
# Written by C. Symonds, 27/04/15

# This script restarts a previous propagation. To use, call from last propagation set
# folder (eg in /nobackup folder). You should provide the correct number of repeats, 
# cores and folders which should match the parameters from the previous run. If 
# multiple simulations are being run, ensure that the correct folderlist.dat file and
# Outbsbackup directory are using the default names to ensure that there is no 
# overwriting of basis files or confusing of folder lists.

# Checking the input arguments
