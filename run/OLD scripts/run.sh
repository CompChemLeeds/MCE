#    Bash Script for Parallel Open MP execution of the MCE / CCS program           
#    Written by C. Symonds                                                   21/03/17
#
#    This script has been built to be run using SGE. Use of another job submission
#    system may require modifications to certain parts of the script. The script is
#    designed to compile, copy all the required files into an execution folder, and
#    submit the program as a job. Various checks, output handling, parameter setting
#    and module loading procedures are also included.
#
#    To run, you must give three arguments at execution:
#       1) The number of repeats
#       2) The number of parallel threads per folder/node (max 8)
#       3) The number of folders/nodes
#
#    As there are module load commands, the script must be run as source if running
#    on ARC1/ARC2/POLARIS. This means that for a run of 128 repeats using 8 cores 
#    per node and 4 nodes, the execution command would be:
#
#    source ./run.sh 128 8 4 for ARC, or
#
#    ./run.sh 128 8 4 elsewhere
#
#    For portability the program is compiled using gfortran. The ifort 12.1 compiler 
#    results in problems due to a known bug with allocation through subroutines when
#    openMP is enabled, however the intel compiler can be used if not version 12.1
#    and this would require modifications to the makefile in the build folder.  
#    As such, any changes made to the program should take this into account and 
#    endevour to utilise intrinsic functions rather than intel specific or GNU 
#    specific extensions where possible. PGf95 is not supported for compilation.
#
#    Due to the nature of Shared Memory environments, the execution of the program 
#    is split into separate folders, each one containing a separate executable file 
#    which runs on a number of parallel threads defined in argument 2. Since on arc1 
#    there are 8 cores per node, this number of parallel threads is limited to a 
#    maximum of 8. Parallel execution is carried out through the repeat running of 
#    the basis set propagation. As such, argument 1 (the total number of repeats) 
#    must be equal to an integer multiple of 2 * threads * folders. The factor of 2 
#    originates from the propagation of a basis set followed by proagation of the 
#    complex conjugate of that basis set. If however conjugate propagation is not
#    needed and the conjugate repeats flag is disabled in the input.dat file, the 
#    limit will be set at threads * folders. If gnuplot is present on the computer 
#    then a set of graphs are created through the automatic creation and execution 
#    of gnuplot scripts. These scripts, and the data being plotted, are generated 
#    by the avrgpops.exe and timehist.exe executable files, and different plots can
#    be generated through changing the source file of the same name. Each running 
#    of this script runs the makefile to recompile the program if necessary. 
#
#    If you are running with a precalculated set of basis sets, put the output files 
#    from the basis set calculation in the run folder before execution and conjugate 
#    propagation should be disabled.
