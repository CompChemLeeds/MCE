# System (Currently can be SB [Spin Boson], HP [Harmonic Potential], FP [Free Particle], DL [Spin Boson with Drude-Lorentz]
#    MP [Morse Potential], IV [Inverted Gaussian], CP [Coulomb Potential], or HH [Henon-Heiles]. SB, DL works only with MCE, all others with CCS. 
System: SB

#Debug flag [ 0: no debug outputs, 1: debug outputs. Does not really work for dynamic basis set sizes]
debug 0

#Basis Set Generation flag [YES/NO for generating the basis set]
gen YES

#Basis Set Propagation flag [YES/NO for propagating the basis set]
prop YES

#Restart flag [1/0 for restarting a previously timed out simulation. This should be automatically set by the restart script]

#Flag for adaptive altering of the compression parameter in swarms/grid-swarms/train-swarms or the grid spacing for grids. [YES/NO]
cmprss YES

#Propagation method [can be CCS, MCEv1, MCEv2, AIMC-MCE1 (first pass), AIMC-MCE2 (Second pass) or MCE12 (uses both MCE methods). No support for vMCG, F-CCS or 2L-CCS yet.]
